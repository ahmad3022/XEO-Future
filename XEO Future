You are a senior full-stack web developer.  
Build me a fully functional, responsive, modern multi-tool website called "Tools Pack".   
Requirements:

ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack:
- Pure HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript only.
- No backend, no external libraries, no frameworks (unless browser-native like Canvas or Web Crypto).

ðŸ”¹ Design Theme & Aesthetic:
- Background: #1E1E2F (dark navy).
- Premium, minimal, modern UI with smooth transitions.
- Responsive design (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- Grid/card layout for tools, with search/filter.

ðŸ”¹ Core Features (all must be functional):
1. Calculator (basic arithmetic).
2. Unit Converter (length, weight, temperature).
3. Text Utilities (uppercase/lowercase, word count, remove spaces).
4. Base64 Encode/Decode.
5. URL Encoder/Decoder.
6. JSON Formatter/Validator.
7. Password Generator (length, complexity).
8. UUID Generator (v4).
9. Hash Generator (SHA-256 via WebCrypto API).
10. Image Resizer & Compressor (Canvas).
11. Color Picker + Contrast Checker.
12. Stopwatch & Countdown Timer.
13. Quick Notes (localStorage persistence).

ðŸ”¹ Additional UX:
- Global search bar (filter tools by name).
- Command palette (Ctrl+K / Cmd+K) for tool quick access.
- Each tool inside a clean responsive card with title + input/output area.
- Dark mode by default.
- with Google Ads Ready & .


ðŸ”¹ Output Rules:
- Deliver entire website code in a **single HTML file** (HTML + CSS + JS together).
- Code must be **optimized, clean, well-structured, and production-ready**.
- Comment important sections for readability.
- Ensure fast load & accessibility (semantic HTML, aria-labels).

Now, generate the complete code in one file.
